# 🎓 FYP Evaluation System (MERN Stack)

This repository showcases selected parts of a **Final Year Project (FYP) Evaluation System** developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system was designed to streamline the entire FYP workflow, making the submission, evaluation, and communication process between students, supervisors, and evaluators more efficient and transparent.

## 🏆 Achievement

> 🥉 **Awarded 2nd Runner-Up** at the University Open House Exhibition for demonstrating innovation, usability, and practical impact.

## 📌 Project Overview

The FYP Evaluation System is a full-stack web application that addresses the common challenges in managing FYP processes in academic institutions. The platform enables:

- **Students** to submit project proposals, documentation, and updates.
- **Supervisors** to review student progress, accept or reject proposals, and provide feedback.
- **Evaluators** to grade submitted work, write evaluations, and communicate with students.
- **Admins** to manage announcements, compile results, and moderate a built-in discussion forum.

The frontend was developed using **React.js**, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend APIs were built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and data was stored in **MongoDB**.

This repository contains only a **partial view of the frontend code** as a sample:

## 🔒 Why Only Partial Code Is Uploaded

Due to academic integrity, institutional policies, and project confidentiality, I have only uploaded **select non-sensitive frontend files**. The complete source code contains private backend logic, database credentials, and evaluation features that are either under review or not permitted for public sharing.

If you're an employer, recruiter, or reviewer and would like to view more of the codebase for assessment or discussion, feel free to [contact me](mailto:your.email@example.com), and I’d be happy to walk you through the full project privately.
